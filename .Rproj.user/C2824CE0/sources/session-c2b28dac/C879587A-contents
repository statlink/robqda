\description{
Cross-validation for the robust quadratic discriminant analysis.
}

\usage{
robqda.cv(x, ina, nfolds = 10, quantile.used = floor((n + p + 1)/2),
nsamp = "best", folds = NULL, stratified = TRUE, seed = NULL)
robqda.cv(x, ina, k = floor(n/2), nfolds = 10, quantile.used = floor((n + p + 1)/2),
nsamp = "best", folds = NULL, stratified = TRUE, seed = NULL)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A matrix with the data.
}
\item{ina}{
A group indicator variable for the avaiable data.
}
\item{nfolds}{
The number of folds in the cross validation.
}
\item{folds}{
If you have the list with the folds supply it here. You can also leave it NULL and it will create folds.
}
\item{quantile.used}{
A number, the minimum number of the data points regarded as good points.
}
\item{nsamp}{
The number of samples or "best", "exact", or "sample". The limit If "sample" the number chosen is min(5 * p, 3000), taken from Rousseeuw and Hubert (1997). If "best" exhaustive enumeration is done up to 5000 samples: if "exact" exhaustive enumeration will be attempted.
}
\item{stratified}{
Do you want the folds to be created in a stratified way? TRUE or FALSE.
}
\item{seed}{
You can specify your own seed number here or leave it NULL.
}
}

\details{
Cross validation is performed to estimate the rate of accuracy in the robust quadratic discriminant analysis. The HD version first computes the PCA of the data, and then uses the first \eqn{n/2} dimensions, approximately, where \eqn{n} denotes the sample size, to perform the cross-validation.
}

\value{
A list including:
\item{per}{
A vector with the estimated rate of correct classification for every fold.
}
\item{percent}{
A matrix with the mean estimated rates of correct classification.
}
\item{runtime}{
The time required by the cross-validation procedure.
}
