Tuning the parameters of the regularised discriminant analysis
}

\description{
Tuning the parameters of the regularised discriminant analysis for Eucldiean data.
}

\usage{
robqda.cv(x, ina, nfolds = 10, uantile.used = floor((n + p + 1)/2),
nsamp = "best", folds = NULL, stratified = TRUE, seed = NULL)
}

\arguments{
\item{x}{
A matrix with the data.
}
\item{ina}{
A group indicator variable for the avaiable data.
}
\item{nfolds}{
The number of folds in the cross validation.
}
\item{folds}{
If you have the list with the folds supply it here. You can also leave it NULL and it will create folds.
}
\item{stratified}{
Do you want the folds to be created in a stratified way? TRUE or FALSE.
}
\item{seed}{
You can specify your own seed number here or leave it NULL.
}
}

\details{
Cross validation is performed to select the optimal parameters for the regularisded discriminant analysis and also estimate the rate of accuracy.

The covariance matrix of each group is calcualted and then the pooled covariance matrix. The spherical covariance matrix consists of the average of the pooled variances in its diagonal and zeros in the off-diagonal elements. gam is the weight of the pooled covariance matrix and 1-gam is the weight of the spherical covariance matrix, Sa = gam * Sp + (1-gam) * sp. Then it is a compromise between LDA and QDA. del is the weight of Sa and 1-del the weight of each group covariance group.

\value{
A list including:
If graph is TRUE a plot of a heatmap of the performance s will appear.
\item{per}{
An array with the estimate rate of correct classification for every fold. For each of the M matrices, the row values correspond to gam and the columns to the del parameter.
}
\item{percent}{
A matrix with the mean estimated rates of correct classification. The row values correspond to gam and the columns to the del parameter.
}
\item{se}{
A matrix with the standard error of the mean estimated rates of correct classification. The row values correspond to gam and the columns to the del parameter.
}
\item{result}{
The estimated rate of correct classification along with the best gam and del parameters.
}
\item{runtime}{
The time required by the cross-validation procedure.
}
